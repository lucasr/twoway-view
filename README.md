NOTE: TwoWayView's API is not final yet. Although the library is fairly
funcional, this is still beta-quality code. Do not rely on it for production
code just yet. Feedback is very welcome!

What is it?
===========

ListView-like widget with support for vertical and horizontal scrolling.

Features
========

* Proper view recycling while scrolling, just like ListView/GridView.
* Vertical and horizontal scrolling support.

How do I use it?
================

1. Add TwoWayView's jar as a dependency to your project.

2. Add a `TwoWayView` to your layout.

3. Set an Adapter to the TwoWayView.

The sample app uses all features available in the widget.

Want to help?
=============

File new issues to discuss specific aspects of the API and to propose new
features.
