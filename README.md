  * Grid
  * Staggered Grid
  * Spannable Grid

  * Item selection (single and multiple) support e.g. *setChoiceMode()*, *setItemChecked(int, boolean)*, etc.

Snapshot
========

The new API is still under heavy development but you can try it now via Maven Central snapshots.

Gradle:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/" }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'org.lucasr.twowayview:core:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT@aar'
    compile 'org.lucasr.twowayview:layouts:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT@aar'
}
```

Stable Release
==============

TwoWayView used to be a standalone *AdapterView* implementation. You can grab it here from Maven Central as follows.

Grab via Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.lucasr.twowayview</groupId>
  <artifactId>twowayview</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.4</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:
```groovy
compile 'org.lucasr.twowayview:twowayview:0.1.4'
```

If you are using ProGuard add the following line to the rules:
```groovy
-keep class org.lucasr.twowayview.** { *; }
```
